# Supabase Migrations

This folder contains migration files generated by the Supabase CLI.  
Each file represents schema or policy changes made to the database.  

Examples:
- `0001_init.sql` → initial schema
- `20250919xxxx_fix_storage_policies.sql` → fixes for storage policies on the private `bids` bucket

Keep all migrations under version control:
- They are the history of how the database schema and policies evolve.
- On a new environment, `supabase db push` will replay them.
- Do **not** delete them unless you intentionally want to reset schema history.
