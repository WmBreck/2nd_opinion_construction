# Seed instructions

This project does not ship with sample data. After starting the Supabase stack locally (`supabase start`), run migrations to provision the schema and storage bucket:

```bash
supabase migration up
```

Use the Supabase dashboard or CLI to create test users and manual leads/uploads as needed.
